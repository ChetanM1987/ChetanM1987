Loan Eligibility Test using Machine Learning
This project is focused on developing a machine learning model to determine the eligibility of individuals for a loan based on various features provided in the dataset. The implementation is done using Python programming language along with popular data analysis and machine learning libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals including their personal details, financial information, and loan eligibility status. It is stored in CSV format and located in the directory.
